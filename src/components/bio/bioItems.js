 bio: `As a front-end developer i love applying the FLUX Architecture to organize code which utilizes a uni-directional flow of data to build reusable front-end components for client-side web applications which when paired with responsive design principles ensures my web pages are well optimized on multiple mobile screens or a PC. Up to this point I have JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Firebase and Git/GitHub under my belt. I'm still ardent on learning other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can lay my hands on.`
